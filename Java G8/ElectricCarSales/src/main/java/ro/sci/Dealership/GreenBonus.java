//Milestone 1 - OOP Design
//        Create simple UML like diagram of the classes in the system.
//        The diagram should showcase the OOP relationship between the classes.
//        The OOP Design must cover the following:
//        Dealership OOP Model:
//        represents at least one Manufacturer.
//        has a fleet of cars, new and used.
//        has stock nr and price for each car
//        Car OOP Model.
//        Car have electric motors and electric batteries (kw).
//        Car have an energy consumption (kw/km)
//        Car have manufacturers, models and production year.
//        Green Bonus Program
//        Has a fixed budget
//        Has a history of all purchases via the program (client name, dealership name, car model)
