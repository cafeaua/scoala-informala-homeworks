//5 Java OOP Homework
//
//        EV Purchase Program Milestone 2 - Java OOP Implementation
//        Implement relationships between classes from milestone 1.
//
//        You do not need to implement any behavior (i.e selling / buying a car),
//        however the Aggregation and Containment relationships along with any Inheritance must be visible in the code.
//
//  Milestone 1 - OOP Design

//        Create simple UML like diagram of the classes in the system.
//        The diagram should showcase the OOP relationship between the classes.
//        The OOP Design must cover the following:

//        Dealership OOP Model:

//        represents at least one Manufacturer.
//        has a fleet of cars, new and used.
//        has stock nr and price for each car

//        Green Bonus Program

//        Has a fixed budget
//        Has a history of all purchases via the program (client name, dealership name, car model)
